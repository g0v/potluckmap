<p>Potluckmap displays your (perhaps along with others')
geographic data in OpenStreetMap.
It is written in javascript and has
several interesting features:

<p align="center"><img src="potluckmap.jpg"
alt="screenshot of potluckmap" /></p>

<ol>
<li>You can specify several data sources and
it displays all of them on a single map.
<li>The data sources can be provided in some of the
many formats supported by
<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore">leaflet-omnivore</a>,
including .geojson, .gpx, .csv .
Additionally, potluckmap also accepts
the output of OverpassTurbo requests.
<li>Each data source can be instructed to refresh itself
at fixed time intervals.
<li>Each marker can be rotated at a different angle.
(<em>only partially implemented</em>)
<li>You can run potluckmap completely offline
if you have a local tile server and use only local data sources.</p>
</ol>

<p>(1) and (2) makes it suitable for collaboration among different
geographic data providers such as different government departments.
Each party can focus on simply producing its own textual data.
The idea is to separate map data from presentation,
analogous to the idea of "separation of content from presentation"
in word processing or web publishing (html + css).</p>

<p>(3) and (4) makes it suitable for displaying moving vehicles
such as buses, cars, and bikes. City governments all over
the planet would save a lot of map-coding efforts
if they simply publish live bus information in one of
the above-mentioned text formats.
Developers can cooperate on a single map app.
Or more likely, there will be many compatible competing apps,
each serving all cities at once.
Each traveller can choose her/his favourite
and use just that one app across all cities across the globe.</p>

<p>Privacy-conscious users and users who need to use maps offline
will find (5) particularly appealing.</p>

<p>The following is an iframe that includes the demo map.
You can also visit <a href="http://g0v.github.io/potluckmap/potluckmap.html">the demo map</a> by itself.

<p>Head over to <a href=
"http://g0v.github.io/potluckmap/potluckmap.html">
the demo page</a> and begin playing with it.
See a later section on how to save and restore your configuration.

<h2>
<a id="installing-potluckmap" class="anchor" href="#installing-potluckmap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing Potluckmap</h2>

<p>Just download potluckmap and open potluckmap.html in firefox.</p>

<p>Chrome or chromium users who want to use local data sources
have two options. Either install a local web server and
access potluckmap.html through the web server,
or start the browser from the command line:
<code>chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files</code>.
Please see <a href="https://github.com/ckhung/javascriptCanReadLocalFiles">javascriptCanReadLocalFiles</a> for details.</p>

<p>It is possible to share one copy of the codes among
several web pages each of which needs its own map.
<del>When including the potluckmap.js script
In the &lt;script ...&gt; line of each html page,
give it the id "potluckmap_script"
and append "?config=xyz.json" to the src attribute
where xyz.json is the path of this page's
own configuration file, like this: <code>
&lt;script id="potluckmap_script" src="potluckmap.js?config=m/cyut/config.json"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
See <a href="cyut-bus.html">cyut-bus.html</a> for a complete example.</del>
Just append "?config=xyz.json" to the html page's url
and potluckmap.js will use xyz.json as the configuration file.

<p>If you want to run potluckmap offline, you need to have
a local tile server.

<h2>
<a id="basic-setup" class="anchor" href="#basic-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Setup</h2>

<p>Potluckmap does not have a fancy user interface (yet).
You have to edit its configuration file config.json manually.
[2016/11/09: <em>configuration file format changed!</em>
The new config file now only contains a small structure
that corrospends to the "startval" portion of the old config file.]
You can edit the following fields
<del>of the <code>startval</code> portion</del>
in the configuration file:</p>

<ol>
<li>"title": the title of your map.</li>
<li>"sources": the data sources of your map.</li>
<li>"views": a list of frequently used views as defined
by their names, zoom levels, and geographic coordinates.</li>
</ol>

<p>More details in later sections.</p>

<h2>
<a id="using-potluckmap" class="anchor" href="#using-potluckmap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Potluckmap</h2>

<p>In the bottom left corner there are a few menu buttons.</p>

<p>The "pushpin" menu button include options for you to:</p>

<ol>
<li>[some place name] switch to a predefined view</li>
<li>[remember here] replace the current view with
what you are looking at right now</li>
</ol>

<p>The "reload" menu button include options for you to:
<ol>
<li>[reload all] reload all data sources
<li>[reload changed] reload those data sources
that have been manually changed in the configuration area
<li>[rebuild menu] rebuild the pushpin menu after you
manually add entries to, delete entries from,
or change the names of the views list in the configuration area.
</ol>

<a id="saving-and-restoring-your-configuration" class="anchor" href="#saving-and-restoring-your-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Saving and Restoring Your Configuration</h2>

<p>Below the map is the configuration area.
Potluckmap uses <a href="https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor">json-editor</a>
as a lazy programmer's user interface --
options that don't yet have a normal UI can be changed here.
For example, you can add views, delete views,
change the view name here.
However, changes may not go into effect immediately.
That's why there are menu items like [reload changed]
and [rebuild menu] in the map UI.</p>

<p>After you have configured your sources and views,
you may want to save it.
Press the [Edit JSON] button, copy the content,
and (using a text editor) <del>paste it to the
"startval" portion of your new config.json file</del>
save it as your new config.json file.
(Note: the [save] button does not save anything to the disk.
It only confirms your manual editing within this session.)
Potluckmap will then use your new configuration the next time it is run.</p>

<p>If you are visiting <a href=
"http://g0v.github.io/potluckmap/potluckmap.html">
the demo page</a>, then of course it is always
the demo map that gets displayed upon opening the page.
You can still ask it to display your own map
as long as your data files have a public url.
Simply press the [Edit JSON] button, and paste 
<del>the "startval" portion of</del>
your config.json file into the edit window.
Then choose "reload all" from the map.

<p>Beware that the configuration file may undergo
changes as potluckmap is being actively developed.
Your old configuration file may not always work with
a newer version.

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>You can specify the <code>format</code> and the <code>url</code> of each data source.
Leaving the format field empty instructs potluckmap to
choose the format parser according to the file name extension of the url.

<p>Features of type "Point" are styled using the these fields
<code>shap</code>, <code>glyph_set</code>, <code>glyph</code>,
and optionally <code>facing</code>.
The available set of <code>shape</code>s can be previewed at <a href=
"https://github.com/g0v/potluckmap/blob/gh-pages/lib/icons.png">
icons.png</a> .
Leaving the <code>glyph_set</code> empty,
you can type any short text in the <code>glyph</code> field
as the label for markers.
Alternatively, choosing glyphicon as the <code>glyph_set</code>,
you can type the name of one of the <a href=
"http://getbootstrap.com/components/">
bootstrap glyphicons</a> in the <code>glyph</code> field.
Additionally, the <code>facing</code> field may contain
a valid mathematical expression containing one or more
numerical fields from the source data file.
In this case, the icon is rotated by this amount of angle (in degrees).

<p>Features of type "LineString" are styled
using the <code>style</code> field. See <a href="cyut-bus.html">
cyut bus</a> for example.

<p>The <code>refresh</code> field is the number of seconds
for automatically refreshing this source.
However, it must be greater than or equal to 20.

<p>See <a href=
"https://github.com/ckhung/Leaflet.Icon.Glyph">
Leaflet.Icon.Glyph</a> for more details about <code>shape</code>
and <code>glyph</code>.

<h3>Tile Provider</h3>

<p>This option employs the <a href=
"https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers">
leaflet-providers</a> project.
Visit <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/">
their demo</a> to see what each tile provider looks like.
